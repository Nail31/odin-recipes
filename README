I believe during this assignment I will get a chance to put what I have recently learned into use. I will be puttig into practice skills such as creating and connecting your git repository to your project. Using your Html boilerplate I will then be creating a simple website with links to recipes.

After having completed the assignment, I have to say I am quite pleased. It had me use all the information and knowledge I had gained so far and had me utilize it. I had some troubles with the images still, and moving them from my windows to Linux, but grasping more the ability to download the image directly onto the directory from the web. I am also finding it all very interesting and so far feel like I have a grasp of these basics.
